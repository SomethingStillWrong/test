The translation of ALL languages in Bedrock Edition is of low quality.

Let me take Simplified Chinese for example, while other languages have the same situation. (p.s: The following zh-cn problems have nothing to do with Minecraft China Version)

To name a few wrong translations in Simplified Chinese :

And, I recently noticed that a Bedrock Marketplace translation survey was carried out in Win10 Xbox Insider. Yes, someone did take notice of this problem, however a recently released Marketplace content "[Original Bed Wars|https://www.minecraft.net/zh-hans/pdp?id=e5e0b70b-849c-4f99-a5fb-c220f788dd3e]" was translated to something with {*}pornographic meaning{*}. (We all know that "Bed War" (起床战争) is a proper noun, but your translators don't, and translated as "床上大战").
Update: After 2 years this was partially resolved, but there are still half of "bed war" contents like "[BED WARS CLASSIC|https://www.minecraft.net/zh-hans/marketplace/pdp?id=fc5fc023-ab6c-4b34-927e-5fc828a1b619]" that use the wrong translation.

The aforementioned wrong translations are only a small proportion of the whole mess. Just fixing those translation does not solve the whole problem.
A more detaied list of unsynced translation can be found on [Chinese Minecraft Wiki|https://zh.minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:ST/B]
I've made a corrected version of Chinese Simplified translation at [MCLangCN|https://github.com/ff98sha/mclangcn/blob/master/texts/zh_CN.lang] , if you want a full list of the poor translation of Chinese, just head there and compare the current one with what I have corrected.
There's also another project called [Translations for Minecraft (Bedrock)|https://crowdin.com/project/translations-for-minecraft] , which is created by Russian proofreader of Minecraft Java Edition Crowdin project, and consists of more languages. It has 1.95M downloads on curseforge and 500K on Google Play, so it's self-evident that masses of players are unsatisfied with the translation of Bedrock Edition.

And this is a widely affected problem among ALL languages provided in Bedrock. To list a few bug reports (also consider their duplicates):
Brazilian Portuguese: MCPE-50174
Simplified Chinese: MCPE-51997
Dutch: MCPE-35098
German: MCPE-12142
Greek: MCPE-38541
Japanese: MCPE-15805
Korean: MCPE-30684
Polish: MCPE-22243
Russian: MCPE-40591
Turkish: MCPE-21719

Most of the translation bug reports have been unattended and were marked as resolved since they hadn't been updated for 1 year+.
As a game played by millions of users, Mojang and Microsoft should care more about user experience of localization.
The translation problem started from Pocket Edition 0.x version and is being continuously reported, but it's Bedrock 1.21 today and the problem is still not solved.
It's weird that you have assigned the work to those whose translation work is even worse than an online machine translator's.
And don't forget that Bedrock translation is used in Minecraft Education Edition and Minecraft Earth. (And their exclusive contents are exactly translated by the same group of people as Bedrock Edition, inferred from the language files.)

Possible solutions:
1. For a temporary solution, adopt the aforementioned translation from community-based project.
2. Make translation of Bedrock a subproject of [Minecraft Crowdin Projcet|https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft] so that experienced proofreaders of Java Edition can have access to them. (Recommended)
3. Make Translations for Minecraft (Bedrock) an official project and use translation in it (which is also contributed by the community).
4. Assign the work of translating Bedrock Edition to another group of translators. (As far as I know, translator of other Microsoft projects are far better.)

Translation is a big barrier for the synchronization of Java Edition and Bedrock Edition. I hope this issue can make you attach importance to this long-lasting problem.

(P.S. I personally think this maybe the most difficult problem the solve during the contents sync between Java and Bedrock.)
